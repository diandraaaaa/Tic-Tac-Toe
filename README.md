# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
Developed a dynamic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Pygame library. This project showcases my proficiency in programming fundamentals, including object-oriented design, event handling, and graphical user interface development.

- Implemented player vs. computer gameplay with basic AI logic for the computer's moves.
- Utilized Pygame for visual representation, creating an engaging user experience with interactive graphics and smooth animations.
- Demonstrated problem-solving skills by designing algorithms to determine winning conditions and computer moves.
- Designed an intuitive user interface, allowing players to interact with the game seamlessly through mouse clicks.
